## 📎 Excel Techniques Used

### 🔗 Cell Referencing
- Used **absolute and relative references** to build dynamic formulas across sheets
- Linked summary dashboards to raw data using structured references
- Applied **named ranges** for clarity and reusability

### 🧮 Functions & Formulas
- Leveraged core functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`, `COUNTIF`, and `VLOOKUP` to analyze trends
- Built **nested formulas** to calculate profitability thresholds and flag anomalies
- Used **conditional formatting** to visually highlight key metrics

### 📊 Pivot Tables
- Created pivot tables to summarize sales by region, category, and customer segment
- Used `GETPIVOTDATA` for precise referencing and dynamic reporting
- Filtered and grouped data to reveal hidden patterns and performance gaps
- Compared year-over-year metrics and built ratio calculations for financial insights
